}
\value{
A level-1 data frame with a standardized format containing a  
standardized set of columns and column names with hepatic
clearance data for a variety of chemicals.
}
\description{
This function formats data describing mass spectrometry (MS) peak areas
from samples collected as part of \emph{in vitro} measurements of chemical stability
when incubated with suspended hepatocytes \insertCite{shibata2002prediction}{invitroTKstats}.
Disappearance of the chemical over time is assumed to be due to metabolism
by the hepatocytes.
The input data frame is organized into a standard set of columns and is written
to a tab-separated text file.
}
\details{
The data frame of observations should be annotated according to
these types:
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  Blank \tab Blank\cr
  Hepatocyte incubation concentration \tab Cvst\cr
  Inactivated Hepatocytes \tab Inactive\cr
  Calibration Curve \tab CC\cr
}

Chemical concentration is calculated qualitatively as a response and 
returned as a column in the output data frame:

Response <- AREA / ISTD.AREA * ISTD.CONC

If the output level-1 result table is chosen to be exported and an output 
directory is not specified, it will be exported to the user's R session
temporary directory. This temporary directory is a per-session directory 
whose path can be found with the following code: \code{tempdir()}. For more 
details, see \url{https://www.collinberke.com/til/posts/2023-10-24-temp-directories/}.

As a best practice, \code{INPUT.DIR} and/or \code{OUTPUT.DIR} should be 
specified to simplify the process of importing and exporting files. This 
practice ensures that the exported files can easily be found and will not be 
exported to a temporary directory.

\examples{
## Load the example level-0 data
level0 <- invitroTKstats::clint_L0

## Run it through level-1 processing function
## This example shows the use of the data.in argument which allows users to pass
## in a data frame from the R session.
## If the input level-0 data exists in an external file such as a .tsv file,
## users may import it using INPUT.DIR to specify the path and FILENAME
## to specify the file name. See documentation for details.
