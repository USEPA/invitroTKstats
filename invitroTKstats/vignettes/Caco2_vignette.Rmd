## Introduction 

This vignette guides users on how to estimate apparent membrane permeability (P~app~) from mass spectrometry data. Apparent membrane permeability is a chemical specific parameter that describes the general transport of the chemical through a membrane (Honda et al. 2024). 

The mass spectrometry data should be collected from a Caco-2 assay in which the test compound was added to either the apical or basolateral side of a confluent and differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayer as seen in Figure 1 (Honda et al. 2024). 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.cap = "Fig 1: Caco-2 experimental set up", fig.topcaption = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Caco2_diagram.png")
```

### Suggested packages for use with this vignette 

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Primary package 
library(invitroTKstats)
# Data manipulation package 
library(dplyr)
# Table formatting package
library(flextable)
```

## Load Data 

First, we load in the example dataset from `invitroTKstats`. 

```{r Load example data}
# Load example caco2 data 
data("Caco2-example")
```

Three datasets are loaded in: `caco2_L0`, `caco2_L1`, and `caco2_L2`. These datasets are Caco-2 data at Level 0, 1, and 2 respectively. For the purpose of this vignette, we'll start with `caco2_L0`, the Level 0 data, to demonstrate the complete pipelining process. 

`caco2_L0` is the output from the `merge_level0` function which compiles raw lab data from specified Excel files into a singular data frame. The data frame contains exactly one row per sample with information obtained from the mass spectrometer. For more details on curating raw lab data to a singular Level 0 data frame, see "Creating dataguide from raw data vignette". 

The following table displays the first three rows of `caco2_L0`, our Level 0 data.

```{r, echo = FALSE, tab = 1}
head(caco2_L0, n = 3) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  bg(bg = "#DDDDDD", part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_table_properties(
    opts_html = list(
      scroll = list(
      )
      )
  ) %>% 
  set_caption(caption = "Table 1: Level 0 data",
              align_with_table = FALSE) %>% 
  fontsize(size = 10, part = "body") %>% 
  theme_vanilla()
```

## Level 1 processing

`format_caco2` is the Level 1 function used to create a standardized data frame. This level of processing is necessary because naming conventions or formatting can differ across data sets. 

If the Level 0 data already contains the required column, then the existing column name can be specified. For example, `caco2_L0` already contains a column specifying the sample name called "Sample". However, the default column name for sample name is "Lab.Sample.Name". Therefore, we specify the correct column with `sample.col = "Sample"`. In general, to specify an already existing column that differs from the default, the user must use the parameter with the `.col` suffix. 

If the Level 0 data does not already contain the required column, then the entire column can be populated with a single value. For example, `caco2_L0` does not contain a column specifying biological replicates. Therefore, we populate the required column with `biological.replicates = 1`. In general, to specify a single value for an entire column, the user must use the parameter without the `.col` suffix.

Users should be mindful if they choose to specify a single value for all of their samples and verify that that is the action they wish to take. 

Some columns must be present in the Level 0 data while others can be filled with a single value. At minimum, the following columns must be present in the Level 0 data and specification with a single entry is not permitted: `sample.col`, `lab.compound.col`, `dtxsid.col`, `date.col`, `compound.col`, `area.col`, `istd.col`, `type.col`, `direction.col`, `receiver.vol.col`, `donor.vol.col`, and `note.col`.

The rest of the following columns may either be specified from the Level 0 data or filled with a single value: `membrane.area.col` or `membrane.area`, `compound.conc.col` or `compound.conc`, `cal.col` or `cal`, `dilution.col` or `dilution`, `time.col` or `time`, `istd.name.col` or `istd.name`, `istd.conc.col` or `istd.conc`, `nominal.test.conc.col` or `nominal.test.conc`, `biological.replicates.col` or `biological.replicates`, `technical.replicates.col` or `technical.replicates`, `analysis.method.col` or `analysis.method`, `analysis.instrument.col` or `analysis.instrument`, `analysis.parameters.col` or `analysis.parameters`, `level0.file.col` or `level0.file`, and `level0.sheet.col` or `level0.sheet`.

By default, a TSV file containing the Level 1 data is exported to the user's directory. We have omitted this export with `output.res = FALSE`. The option to omit exporting a TSV file is also available at Levels 2 and 3 and will be used from this point forward.

```{r L1 processing}
caco2_L1_curated <- format_caco2(FILENAME = "Caco2_vignette",
                                 data.in = caco2_L0,
                                 # columns present in L0 data 
                                 sample.col = "Sample",

                                 area.col = "Peak.Area",
                                 istd.col = "ISTD.Peak.Area",
                                 compound.conc.col = "Compound.Conc",
                                 analysis.method.col = "Analysis.Params",
                                 # columns not present in L0 data
                                 biological.replicates = 1,
                                 technical.replicates = 1,
                                 membrane.area = 0.11,
                                 cal = 1,
                                 time = 2, 
                                 istd.conc = 1,
                                 nominal.test.conc = 10,
                                 analysis.instrument = "Agilent.GCMS",
                                 analysis.parameters = "Unknown",
                                 note.col = NULL,
                                 # don't export output TSV file
                                 output.res = FALSE
                                 )
```

All of our samples are successfully formatted and returned in `caco2_L1_curated`, our Level 1 data produced from `format_caco2`. Each sample has one of the following sample types

1. Blank with no chemical added (Blank)
2. Dosing vehicle (C0) at target concentration (D0)
3. Donor compartment at the end of the experiment (D2)
4. Receiver compartment at the end of the experiment (R2)

If any samples had a different sample type, they would have been removed and reported to the user. If the user wants to export the removed samples as a TSV, the user should set the parameter `save.bad.types = TRUE`.  

The following table displays the first three samples of `caco2_L1_curated` with a non-Blank sample type. In addition to the columns specified by the user, there is an additional column called `Response`. This column is the test compound concentration and is calculated as $\textrm{Response} = \frac{\textrm{Analyte Area}}{\textrm{ISTD Area}}*\textrm{ISTD Conc}$ where $\textrm{Analyte Area}$ is defined by the `Area` column, $\textrm{ISTD Area}$ is defined by the `ISTD.Area` column, and $\textrm{ISTD Conc}$ is defined by the `ISTD.Conc` column.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Select non-Blank sample type to display Response col 
caco2_L1_curated %>% 
  filter(!Sample.Type %in% c("Blank", "CC")) %>% 
head(n = 3) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  bg(bg = "#DDDDDD", part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_table_properties(
    opts_html = list(
      scroll = list()
      )
  ) %>% 
  set_caption("Table 3: Level 1 data", align_with_table = FALSE) %>% 
  fontsize(size = 10, part = "body") %>% 
  theme_vanilla()
```

Currently, when the ISTD.Area measurement for a sample is 0, the calculated Response is NaN, or not a number, because of the division by 0. In this particular case, all of our samples that have a NaN Response are "Blank" sample types. But, these sample types are needed for point estimation. Users can verify this with the following check. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
all(caco2_L1_curated[is.nan(caco2_L1_curated$Response), "Sample.Type"] == "Blank")
```

Therefore, we replace the NaNs with 0 so that the "Blank" sample types are kept in the dataset and our estimates are accurate. 

```{r}
# Response = Peak.Area/ISTD.Area --> NaN when ISTD.Area = 0 
# Replace the NaNs with 0
caco2_L1_curated <- caco2_L1_curated %>% 
  mutate(Response = ifelse(is.nan(Response) & Sample.Type == "Blank", 0, Response))
```

## Level 2 processing 

`sample_verification` is the Level 2 function used to add a verification column. The verification column indicates whether a sample should be included in the point estimation (Level 3) processing. This column allows users to keep all samples in their data but only utilize the reliable samples for P~app~ estimation. All of the data in Level 2 is identical to the data in Level 1 with the exception of the additional `Verified` column. 

To determine whether a sample should be included, the user should consult the wet-lab scientists from where their data originates. This level of processing allows the user to receive feedback from the wet-lab scientists, exclude erroneous or unreliable samples, and produce new P~app~ estimates. There is an open channel of communication between the user and the wet-lab scientists. 

We will use the already processed Level 2 data frame, `caco2_L2`, to regenerate our exclusion data. Note, all of our samples are verified but we are explaining how to create an exclusion list for learning purposes. In general, the user would not have access to the exclusion information *a priori*. 

The exclusion data frame must include the following columns: `Variables`, `Values`, and `Message`. The `Variables` column contains the variable names used to filter the excluded rows. Here, we are using `Lab.Sample.Name` and `DTXSID` to identify the excluded rows separated by a "|". The `Values` column contains the values of the variables, as a character, also separated by a "|". The `Message` column contains the reason for exclusion. Here, we are using the reasons listed in the `Verified` column in `caco2_L2`. The user should refrain from using "|" in any of their descriptions to avoid conflicts with the `sample_verification` function.

```{r L2 processing exclusion}
# Use verification data from loaded in `caco2_L2` data frame 
exclusion <- caco2_L2 %>% 
  filter(Verified != "Y") %>% 
  mutate("Variables" = "Lab.Sample.Name|DTXSID") %>% 
  mutate("Values" = paste(Lab.Sample.Name, DTXSID, sep = "|")) %>% 
  mutate("Message" = Verified) %>% 
  select(Variables, Values, Message)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE }
exclusion %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  bg(bg = "#DDDDDD", part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_table_properties(
    opts_html = list(
      scroll = list()
      )
  ) %>% 
  set_caption("Table 4: Exclusion data frame", align_with_table = FALSE) %>% 
  fontsize(size = 10, part = "body") %>% 
  theme_vanilla()
```

As expected, our exclusion data frame is empty because all of our samples are verified. If all of the user's samples are verified, they simply do not provide an `exclusion.info` data frame in `sample_verification`. 

```{r}
caco2_L2_curated <- sample_verification(FILENAME = "Caco2_vignette",
                                        data.in = caco2_L1_curated,
                                        assay = "Caco-2",
                                        # don't export output TSV file
                                        output.res = FALSE)
```

Our Level 2 data now contains a `Verified` column. If the sample should be included, the column contains a "Y" for yes. If the sample should be excluded, the column contains the reason for exclusion. 

The following table displays some rows of the Level 2 data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
caco2_L2_curated %>% 
  head(n = 3) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  bg(bg = "#DDDDDD", part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_table_properties(
    opts_html = list(
      scroll = list()
      )
  ) %>% 
  set_caption("Table 5: Level 2 data", align_with_table = FALSE) %>% 
  fontsize(size = 10, part = "body") %>% 
  theme_vanilla()
```

## Level 3 processing 

`calc_caco2_point` is the Level 3 function used to calculate the P~app~ point estimate for each test compound using a Frequentist framework.

Mathematically, P~app~ is the amount of compound transported per unit time and is defined as $$P_{app} = \frac{dQ/dt}{c_0*A}$$ where $dQ/dt$ is the rate of permeation, $c_0$ is the initial concentration in the donor compartment, and $A$ is the surface area of the cell monolayer. 

First, we define the rate of permeation as the amount of compound passing through the monolayer per unit time. It is expressed as 
$$\frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{c_{\textrm{receiver}}V_{\textrm{receiver}}}{\Delta t}$$ where $c_{\textrm{receiver}}$ is the concentration of the test compound in the receiver compartment, $V_{\textrm{receiver}}$ is the volume of the receiver compartment, and $\Delta t$ is the total elapsed time. This rate is a type of flux and therefore has units of $\mu \textrm{mol}/s$. The dimensional analysis is described below. 
$$\left[\frac{dQ}{dt}\right] = \frac{[c_{\textrm{receiver}}][V_{\textrm{receiver}}]}{[\Delta t]} = \frac{[\mu \textrm{mol/L}][L]}{[s]} = \frac{[\mu \textrm{mol}]}{[s]} $$

Next, to estimate $c_\textrm{receiver}$, we multiply the mean R2 response with its corresponding dilution factor and subtract the mean blank response to account for noise such that $$c_\textrm{receiver} = \textrm{dilution factor}_{R2} * \overline{Response}_{R2} - \textrm{dilution factor}_{Blank} * \overline{Response}_{Blank}$$. 

The initial concentration in the donor compartment, $c_0$, is calculated similarly but with the mean D0 response instead of the mean R2 response. 

The last remaining arguments are estimated with columns in our data; $V_\textrm{receiver}$ is defined by our `Vol.Receiver` column, $\Delta t$ is defined by our `Time` column, and $A$ is defined by our `Membrane.Area` column. 

With this information, we calculate P~app~ in the donor to receiver direction. The estimate's direction is annotated according to Figure 1. For example, results annotated with the "A2B" suffix denote the apical side as the donor and the basal side as the receiver. 

```{r}
caco2_L3_curated <- calc_caco2_point(FILENAME = "Caco2_vignette",
                                     data.in = caco2_L2_curated, 
                                     # don't export output TSV file 
                                     output.res = FALSE
                                     )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
caco2_L3_curated %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  bg(bg = "#DDDDDD", part = "header") %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_table_properties(
    opts_html = list(
      scroll = list()
      )
  ) %>% 
  set_caption("Table 6: Level 3 data", align_with_table = FALSE) %>% 
  fontsize(size = 10, part = "body") %>% 
  theme_vanilla()
```

In addition to returning an estimate for `Papp` and its components (`C0`, `dQdt`) in both directions, our Level 3 data contains estimates for the efflux ratio (`Refflux`), the fraction recovered (`Frec`), and the qualitative category of the fraction recovered (`Recovery_Class`). 

The efflux ratio is the ratio between the apparent membrane permeabilities and is expressed as $$R_{\textrm{efflux}} = \frac{P_{app}^{B2A}}{P_{app}^{A2B}}$$. 

The fraction recovered is the fraction of the initial donor amount recovered in the receiver compartment; it assesses the accuracy of the analytical chemistry method used to determine concentration values. It is expressed as $$ \frac{V_{D2}*\textrm{DF}_{D2}*(Responses_{D2} - \overline{Response}_{Blank}) + V_{R2}*\textrm{DF}_{R2}*(Responses_{R2} - \overline{Response}_{Blank})}{V_{D0}*\textrm{DF}_{D0}*(Responses_{D0} - \overline{Response}_{Blank})} $$ where $V$ is the corresponding volume, $\textrm{DF}$ is the corresponding dilution factor, $Responses$ are the corresponding responses, and $\overline{Response}_{Blank}$ is the mean blank response. 

Fraction recovered values are then classified and provided as the `Recovery_Class` value. Values $<0.4$ are classified as "Low Recovery" and values $>2$ are classified as "High Recovery". Values within this range, $0.4 \leq \textrm{Frec} \leq 2$, are considered normal and are not given a classification. 

Looking at our results, some of our `Frec` values are less than $0.4$ and are therefore classified as "Low Recovery". Others are within the $[0.4, 2]$ range and are therefore considered normal, which is why they are not classified. 

## Best Practices: Food for thought 

Generally, data processing pipelines should include minimal to no manual coding. It is best to keep clean code that is easily reproducible and transferable. The user should aim to have all the required data and meta-data files properly formatted to avoid further modifications throughout the pipeline.
