\title{Creates a Summary Table of Mass-Spectrometry (MS) Data}
\usage{
summarize_table(
  input.table,
  dtxsid.col = "DTXSID",
  compound.col = "Compound.Name",
  cal.col = "Calibration",
  type.col = "Sample.Type",
  req.types = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.table}{(Data Frame) A data frame (Level-1 or Level-2) containing mass-spectrometry peak areas,
indication of chemical identity, and measurement type. The data frame should
contain columns with names specified by the following arguments:}

\item{dtxsid.col}{(Character) Column name of \code{input.table} containing EPA's DSSTox Structure
ID (\url{http://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard}). (Defaults to "DTXSID".)}

\item{compound.col}{(Character) Column name of \code{input.table} containing the test compound.
(Defaults to "Compound.Name".)}

\item{cal.col}{(Character) Column name of \code{input.table} containing the MS calibration. 
Calibration typically uses indices or dates to represent if the analyses were done on 
different machines on the same day or on different days with the same MS analyzer. 
(Defaults to "Calibration".)}

\item{type.col}{(Character) Column name of \code{input.table} containing the sample type (see tables
in Details). (Defaults to "Sample.Type".)}

\item{req.types}{(Character Vector) A vector of character strings containing
measurement types. If a vector is specified, each chemical-calibration pair will be 
checked if it has observations for all of the measurement types in the vector. (Defaults to \code{NULL}.)}
}
\value{
A list containing the summary counts from the input data table. The list includes 
the number of observations, the number of unique chemicals, the number of unique measurements, 
the number of chemicals with complete data sets, the number of chemicals with incomplete data sets, 
and the number of chemicals with repeated observations.
}
\description{
This function creates and returns a list containing summary counts from the provided data frame containing
mass-spectrometry (MS) data, MS calibration, chemical identifiers, and measurement type.
The list includes the number of observations, unique chemicals, unique 
measurements in the input data table, and a vector of chemicals that have repeated observations. 
If a vector of data types is specified in the argument \code{req.types}, the function also checks if each chemical has 
observations for every measurement type included in the vector for each chemical-calibration pair. 
If it does, the chemical is said to have a complete data set. Otherwise, it has an incomplete data set. 
The number of complete and incomplete datasets, for each chemical, are returned in the output list. 
The input data frame can be Level-1 (or Level-2) Caco-2 data, ultracentrifugation (UC) data, rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) data, 
or hepatocyte clearance (Clint) data. See the Details section for measurement type and 
annotation tables used in each assay.
}
\details{
Sample types used in ultracentrifugation (UC) data collected for calculation of 
chemical fraction unbound in plasma (Fup) should be annotated as follows:
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  Calibration Curve \tab CC\cr
  Ultracentrifugation Aqueous Fraction \tab AF\cr
  Whole Plasma T1h Sample  \tab T1\cr
  Whole Plasma T5h Sample \tab T5\cr
}

Samples types used in rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) data collected for calculation of 
chemical fraction unbound in plasma (Fup) should be annotated as follows:
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  Blank (ignored) \tab Blank\cr
  Plasma well concentration \tab Plasma\cr
  Phosphate-buffered well concentration\tab PBS\cr
  Time zero plasma concentration \tab T0\cr
  Plasma stability sample \tab Stability\cr
  Equilibrium Control Well 1 \tab EC1\cr
  Equilibrium Control Well 2 \tab EC2\cr
  Calibration Curve \tab CC\cr
}

Sample types in hepatocyte clearance (Clint) data should be annotated as follows:
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  Blank \tab Blank\cr
  Hepatocyte incubation concentration \tab Cvst\cr
  Inactivated Hepatocytes \tab Inactive\cr
  Calibration Curve \tab CC\cr
}

Samples types used in Caco-2 data to calculate membrane permeability should 
be annotated as follows:
\tabular{rr}{
  Blank with no chemical added \tab Blank \cr
  Dosing vehicle (C0) at target concentration \tab D0\cr
  Donor compartment at end of experiment \tab D2\cr
  Receiver compartment at end of experiment\tab R2\cr
