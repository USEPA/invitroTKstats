\value{
A Level-1 data frame with a standardized format containing a  
standardized set of columns and column names with membrane permeability data
from a Caco-2 assay.
}
\description{
This function formats data describing mass spectrometry (MS) peak areas
from samples collected as part of in vitro measurement of membrane
permeability using Caco-2 cells \insertCite{hubatsch2007determination}{invitroTKstats}.
The input data frame is organized into a standard set of columns and is
written to a tab-separated text file.
}
\details{
In this experiment an
in vitro well is separated into two by a membrane composed of a monolayer of
Caco-2 cells. A test chemical is added to either the apical or basolateral side of
of the monolayer at time 0, and after a set time samples are taken from both
the "donor" (side where the test chemical was added) and the "receiver" side.
Depending on the direction of the test the donor side can be either apical or
basolateral.

The data frame of observations should be annotated according to direction
(either apical to basolateral -- "AtoB" -- or basolateral to apical -- "BtoA") and type
of concentration measured:
\tabular{rr}{
  Blank with no chemical added \tab Blank \cr
  Target concentration added to donor compartment at time 0 (C0) \tab D0\cr
  Donor compartment at end of experiment \tab D2\cr
  Receiver compartment at end of experiment\tab R2\cr
}

Chemical concentration is calculated qualitatively as a response and 
returned as a column in the output data frame:

Response <- AREA / ISTD.AREA * ISTD.CONC
