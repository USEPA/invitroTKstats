\value{
A level-1 data frame with a standardized format containing a  
standardized set of columns and column names with plasma protein
binding (PPB) data from an rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) assay.
}
\description{
This function formats data describing mass spectrometry (MS) peak areas
from samples collected as part of \emph{in vitro} measurements of chemical fraction
unbound in plasma using rapid equilibrium dialysis
\insertCite{waters2008validation}{invitroTKstats}.
The input data frame is organized into a standard set of columns and written
to a tab-separated text file.
}
\details{
The data frame of observations should be annotated according to these types:
\tabular{rrrrr}{
  No Plasma Blank (no chemical, no plasma) \tab NoPlasma.Blank\cr
  Plasma Blank (no chemical, just plasma) \tab Plasma.Blank\cr 
  Plasma well concentration \tab Plasma\cr
  Phosphate-buffered well concentration\tab PBS\cr
  Time zero plasma concentration \tab T0\cr
  Plasma stability sample \tab Stability\cr
  Acceptor compartment of the equilibrium evaluation \tab EC_acceptor\cr
  Donor compartment of the equilibrium evaluation (chemical spiked side) \tab EC_donor\cr
  Calibration Curve \tab CC\cr
}
Chemical concentration is calculated qualitatively as a response and 
returned as a column in the output data frame:

Response <- AREA / ISTD.AREA * ISTD.CONC

If the output level-1 result table is chosen to be exported and an output 
directory is not specified, it will be exported to the user's R session
temporary directory. This temporary directory is a per-session directory 
whose path can be found with the following code: \code{tempdir()}. For more 
details, see \url{https://www.collinberke.com/til/posts/2023-10-24-temp-directories/}.

As a best practice, \code{INPUT.DIR} and/or \code{OUTPUT.DIR} should be 
specified to simplify the process of importing and exporting files. This 
practice ensures that the exported files can easily be found and will not be 
exported to a temporary directory.
