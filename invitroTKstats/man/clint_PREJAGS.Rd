\description{
The arguments given to JAGS for the tested compound during level-4 processing of mass spectrometry
measurements of intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint) for cryopreserved 
pooled human hepatocytes. Chemicals were per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substance
(PFAS) samples. The experiments were led by Dr.s Marci Smeltz and Barbara Wetmore 
\insertCite{smeltz2023plasma}{invitroTKstats}. This list is overwritten for each tested
compound. Therefore, only contains arguments given to JAGS for the last tested compound.
