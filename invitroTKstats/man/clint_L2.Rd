\description{
Mass Spectrometry measurements of intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint) for cryopreserved 
pooled human hepatocytes. Chemicals were per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substance
(PFAS) samples. The experiments were led by Dr.s Marci Smeltz and Barbara Wetmore 
\insertCite{smeltz2023plasma}{invitroTKstats}. This data set is a subset of 
experimental data containing samples for 3 test analytes/compounds.
