\description{
The arguments given to JAGS for the tested compound during level 4 processing of mass spectrometry measurements of plasma protein binding (PPB) via rapid 
equilibrium dialysis (RED) for per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substance
(PFAS) samples. Experiments were led by Dr.s Marci Smeltz and Barbara Wetmore 
\insertCite{smeltz2023plasma}{invitroTKstats}. This list is overwritten for each tested
compound. Therefore, only contains arguments given to JAGS for the last tested compound.
