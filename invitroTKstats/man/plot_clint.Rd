\title{Plot Mass Spec. Response for Measurement of Intrinsic Hepatic Clearance}
\usage{
plot_clint(level2, dtxsid)
}
\arguments{
\item{level2}{(Data Frame) A data frame containing Level-2 data for measurement 
of chemical stability when incubated with suspended hepatocytes.}

\item{dtxsid}{(Character) EPA's DSSTox Structure ID for the chemical to be plotted.}
}
\value{
\item{ggplot2}{A figure of mass spec. responses for different sample types.}
}
\description{
This function generates a response-versus-time plot using mass spectrometry (MS) 
responses collected for measurement of a chemical's intrinsic hepatic clearance.
Responses from different measurements/calibrations are labeled with different colors, 
and responses of different sample types are labeled with different shapes.
}
\details{
The input data frame to this function should be "Level-2" data. Level-2 data is Level-1,
data formatted with the \code{\link{format_clint}} function, and curated
with a verification column. "Y" in the verification column indicates the
data row is valid for plotting.
