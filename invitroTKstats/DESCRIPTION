Title: Tools for Analyzing In Vitro Toxicokinetic Measurements
Description: These functions were developed for performing Bayesian
             statistical analysis of in vitro measurements to characterize
             chemical toxicokinetics. Currently they focus on measurement of
             chemical fraction unbound in the presence of plasma (f_up) as 
             measured using Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis () and measurment of
             intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint, uL/min/million hepatocytes)
             as measured using primary hepatocytes (). The methods provided
             by the package were described in Wambaugh et al. (2019).
