Title: In Vitro Toxicokinetic Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline
Description: A set of tools for processing and analyzing in vitro toxicokinetic
             measurements in a standardized and reproducible pipeline. The package
             was developed to perform frequentist and Bayesian estimation on a
             variety of in vitro toxicokinetic measurements including -- but not
             limited to -- chemical fraction unbound in the presence of plasma
             (f_up), intrinsic hepatic clearance (Clint,
             uL/min/million hepatocytes), and membrane permeability for
             oral absorption (Caco2). The methods provided
             by the package were described in \insertCite{wambaugh2019assessing}.
