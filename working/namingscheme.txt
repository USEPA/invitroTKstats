My naming scheme is- 
assay (UC)
compound group (GC1 indicates the 1st group of GC-able compounds)
assay fraction (AF/T1/T5)
compound set w/in the group of compounds (S1/S2/S3)
replicate (A/B/C). 

So, UCG1AFS1C_SE 10/11 would be Ultracentrifugation assay for GC group 1 compounds, the aqueous fraction, set 1, replicate c. 

Set 1 includes 908 & 909, Set 2 916 & 923, and Set 3 3117. Does that help clarify things?
