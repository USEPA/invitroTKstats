Why does DTXSID00192353 have a decrease?


Why all DTXSID00880026 ISTD NA?

ask barbara about DTXSID1067629?


need to check DTXSID30891564 and DTXSID5030030


DTXSID6067331 should be called unstable -- inactive cell sample lower than with cells
		


what is going on with DTXSID8047553? no cell controls higher again
